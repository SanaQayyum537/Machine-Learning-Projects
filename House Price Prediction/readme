This project focuses on predicting house prices across different cities in Pakistan using a comprehensive dataset available on Kaggle.
The aim is to develop machine learning models that can help estimate the price of a property based on various factors like property type, city, and area size.
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle.

Key Steps in the Project

Data Cleaning:
Removed unnecessary columns such as URLs, agents, and location details that don't contribute to the price prediction.
Filtered out properties with inconsistent or unrealistic values.

Feature Engineering:
Converted area sizes into a consistent measurement (square feet) based on the type of area unit (Marla or Kanal).
Computed price per square foot to standardize the price comparison across properties.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized the average price distribution by city and property type.
Observed that Lahore had the highest average property prices, followed by Karachi and Islamabad.
Noted that farmhouses had the highest average price, followed by houses and flats.

Log Transformation:
Applied a log transformation to the target variable (price per square foot) to handle right-skewed distribution and mitigate the impact of outliers.


Modeling:
Linear Regression: A baseline model was trained on the log-transformed data, achieving strong performance after applying the transformation, which improved the model's ability to handle skewed data.
Random Forest: A more robust ensemble model was used to capture non-linear relationships and further improve the accuracy of price predictions.
