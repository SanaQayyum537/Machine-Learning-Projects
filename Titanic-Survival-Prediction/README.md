Project Overview

The Titanic survival prediction task involves analyzing and preprocessing historical passenger data from the Titanic disaster to build a model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not. This project includes the following main steps:

Data Analysis and Preprocessing:

Data Exploration: Explored the dataset to understand the features and identify any anomalies or missing values.
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and outliers to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Created new features and transformed existing ones to improve the performance of the model.
Model Building:

Logistic Regression: Implemented a logistic regression model to predict survival chances based on the processed data.

Evaluation:

Evaluated the performance of the model using appropriate metrics to assess its accuracy and effectiveness.
